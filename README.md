# 🌐 English to Hindi Machine Translation (Seq2Seq + GRU)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system to translate English sentences into Hindi using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with GRU (Gated Recurrent Units).

The model learns to map English text to Hindi by understanding context and generating translations word-by-word.
